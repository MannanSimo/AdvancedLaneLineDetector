## Advanced Lane Line Detection
Yet another lane lane detection with pytnon and OpenCV for Udacity SDCND.

## Goals
* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## How to run
1. Download/Clone the repo.
2. Make sure you have OpenCV installed for Python.
3. Execute the main.py script
```
python main.py
```
4. Make changes accordingly to use any other video file you might want to.
